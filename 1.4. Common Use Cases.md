Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of **Common Use Cases** of GitHub Actions, along with **interview questions** and **scenario-based examples**:

---

## âœ… 14. Common Use Cases â€“ Detailed Notes

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Run Tests on Pull Requests**

Automatically run unit, integration, or end-to-end tests whenever a PR is opened or updated.

```yaml
on: [pull_request]
```

âœ… Helps catch bugs before merging to `main`
âœ… Enables required status checks

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Deploy Code to Cloud Platforms**

Automate deployment to:

* **AWS**: Use actions like `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`
* **Azure**: Use `azure/webapps-deploy`
* **GCP**: Use `google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions`

âœ… Seamless CI/CD
âœ… Supports staging and production environments
âœ… Can integrate manual approvals via `workflow_dispatch`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Lint and Format Code**

Auto-lint or format on push or PR:

* ESLint for JavaScript
* Prettier for formatting
* Flake8/Black for Python

```yaml
run: npm run lint
```

âœ… Maintains code quality
âœ… Can auto-fix issues with `run: npm run lint -- --fix`

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Build and Push Docker Images**

Build containers and publish to:

* DockerHub
* GitHub Container Registry
* AWS ECR, GCP Container Registry

```yaml
run: |
  docker build -t my-app .
  docker push my-app
```

âœ… Enables microservices or container-based delivery
âœ… Supports version tagging and caching

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Send Slack or Email Notifications**

Integrate alerts into workflow steps:

* Use `slackapi/slack-github-action` for Slack
* Use `dawidd6/action-send-mail` for email

âœ… Get real-time build/test/deploy status
âœ… Useful for team collaboration and incident response

## ðŸŽ¯ Interview Questions + Answers

---

### 1. **What are common tasks automated using GitHub Actions?**

* Run tests on PRs
* Lint code
* Build and deploy to cloud
* Push Docker images
* Send notifications to Slack/Email

---

### 2. **How can you trigger deployment only after tests pass?**

Use `jobs.<job_id>.needs` in YAML to ensure deployment only runs after the test job succeeds.

---

### 3. **What is a real-world use case for matrix builds?**

Testing a Node.js app across versions 16, 18, and OSes like Ubuntu and Windows in parallel.

---

### 4. **How do you integrate GitHub Actions with Slack?**

Use a Slack incoming webhook or install `slackapi/slack-github-action` and configure the webhook URL via GitHub Secrets.

---

## ðŸ§© Scenario-Based Questions

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** You want to prevent unformatted code from being merged. What do you do?

**A:**
Set up a GitHub Action that runs Prettier or ESLint on PRs and fails if formatting/linting doesnâ€™t pass.
Optionally, add a commit hook or auto-format step.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** How would you automate deployment of a Dockerized app to AWS ECR on every push to `main`?

**A:**
Create a workflow that:

* Builds the Docker image
* Logs in to ECR using AWS credentials
* Pushes the image to ECR
* (Optional) Triggers ECS or Lambda deployment

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** Your team wants alerts on Slack when a production deploy starts or fails. How?

**A:**
Add a step using Slack action:

```yaml
- uses: slackapi/slack-github-action
  with:
    payload: '{"text":"ðŸš€ Production deploy started!"}'
```

Use `if: failure()` to send messages only on failure.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 4:**

**Q:** A PR introduces a bug, but it passed CI. What could be missing?

**A:**
The PR may have skipped integration or end-to-end tests. Ensure:

* All relevant test suites run in PR workflows
* Coverage thresholds are enforced

Let me know if you want YAML templates for any of the use cases (like Docker push, AWS deploy, or Slack alerts)!
