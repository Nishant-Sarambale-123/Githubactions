### 🔁 **Reusable Workflows in GitHub Actions**

Reusable workflows allow you to define a common set of steps once and **call them from other workflows**, promoting **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.

---

## ✅ **Why Use Reusable Workflows?**

* Standardize processes (build, test, deploy).
* Share workflows across multiple repos or projects.
* Simplify maintenance and updates.

---

## 📦 **Example Scenario**

You want to **reuse a test workflow** across multiple services.

---

### 🗂️ **1. Create Reusable Workflow File**

**File:** `.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml`

```yaml
# Reusable Workflow: reusable-test.yml
name: Reusable Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:  # Enables reuse
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET:
        required: false

jobs:
  run-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Use secret if available
        run: echo "Secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}"
```

---

### 🧩 **2. Call Reusable Workflow from Another Workflow**

**File:** `.github/workflows/main.yml`

```yaml
# Caller Workflow
name: Call Reusable Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  use-reusable:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml  # Local reference
    with:
      node-version: '18'
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
```

---

## 🌍 **Cross-Repository Reuse Example**

Call a reusable workflow from another repo:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-reusable:
    uses: my-org/my-repo/.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml@main
    with:
      node-version: '20'
    secrets:
      MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
```

---

## 📝 **Notes**

* `workflow_call` must be defined in the reusable workflow.
* Inputs and secrets are passed via `with:` and `secrets:` respectively.
* Version pin external workflows with `@tag`, `@commit`, or `@branch`.

## ✅ 10. **Reusable Workflows – Detailed Notes**

---

### 🔹 **What Are Reusable Workflows?**

Reusable workflows allow you to define a **generic, repeatable workflow** and then **call it from other workflows** across the same or different repositories.

🔁 This reduces duplication and promotes standardization in CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 🔹 **How It Works**

#### ✅ **Caller Workflow Example**

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
    with:
      env: prod
```

#### ✅ **Reusable Workflow (`deploy.yml`)**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      env:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.env }}"
```

---

### 🔹 **Key Features**

* Accept **inputs**, **secrets**, and **environment variables**
* Can be versioned and reused across multiple repositories
* Helps implement **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles

---

### 🔹 **Use Cases**

* Common `build`, `test`, or `deploy` routines across services
* Compliance enforcement pipelines
* Template pipelines for microservices

---

## 🎯 **Interview Questions + Answers**

---

### 1. **What is a reusable workflow in GitHub Actions?**

A reusable workflow is a predefined workflow that can be called from other workflows using the `uses:` keyword, enabling shared automation logic.

---

### 2. **What is the purpose of `workflow_call`?**

It defines that a workflow can be **invoked by another workflow**, and optionally takes **inputs** and **secrets**.

---

### 3. **How do you pass parameters to a reusable workflow?**

Using the `with:` block for inputs and `secrets:` for sensitive values.

```yaml
with:
  env: staging
secrets:
  token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

---

### 4. **Can reusable workflows run in different repositories?**

Yes, you can call a reusable workflow from another repository like:

```yaml
uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
```

---

## 🧩 **Scenario-Based Q\&A**

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** Your team has 10 services using the same `build-and-test` process. How do you avoid repeating YAML code?

**A:**
Create a reusable workflow `build-test.yml` in `.github/workflows/`, and call it in each service's workflow using:

```yaml
uses: org/common-pipeline/.github/workflows/build-test.yml@main
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You want your reusable workflow to accept a deployment environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). How?

**A:**
In `reusable-deploy.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      env:
        required: true
        type: string
```

Then in the caller:

```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
with:
  env: prod
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** How do you secure secret tokens passed to reusable workflows?

**A:**
Declare secrets in the caller:

```yaml
secrets:
  api_token: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
```

In the reusable workflow, access them via:

```yaml
env:
  TOKEN: ${{ secrets.api_token }}
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 4:**

**Q:** What if the called workflow is updated in another repo?

**A:**
You must reference the correct version/tag/commit in `uses:`:

```yaml
uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@v1.2.0
```

This prevents unintentional breaking changes.
