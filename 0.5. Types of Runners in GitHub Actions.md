Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the **Types of Runners** in GitHub Actions, along with **interview** and **scenario-based questions**:

---

## âœ… **5. Types of Runners in GitHub Actions**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. GitHub-Hosted Runners**

GitHub provides and maintains a pool of pre-configured **virtual machines (VMs)** to run your jobs. These are called **GitHub-hosted runners**.

#### âœ… Common runner types:

| Runner Label     | OS Type | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ubuntu-latest`  | Linux   | Most popular, fast, supports Docker |
| `windows-latest` | Windows | Useful for Windows-specific builds  |
| `macos-latest`   | macOS   | Required for iOS/macOS development  |

#### âœ… Features:

* Pre-installed tools (Node.js, Python, Docker, Java, etc.)
* Maintained and updated by GitHub
* Free minutes for public repos; limited quota for private repos

#### âœ… Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Self-Hosted Runners**

These are **machines you manage** and connect to your GitHub repo, org, or enterprise.

#### âœ… When to use:

* Need specific software/hardware (e.g., GPU, custom libraries)
* Want full control over environment
* Avoid GitHub-hosted minute limits

#### âœ… Considerations:

* You are responsible for setup, security, and updates.
* Jobs are **queued** until your machine is available.
* They can be registered to individual repos, orgs, or enterprise accounts.

#### âœ… Example:

```yaml
runs-on: self-hosted
```

You can combine labels for filtering:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Interview Questions with Answers**

---

### 1. **What is the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners?**

* **GitHub-hosted runners** are virtual machines provided by GitHub with preinstalled tools and are maintained automatically.
* **Self-hosted runners** are machines you configure and manage. You have full control over the environment, software, and resources.

---

### 2. **Why would you use a self-hosted runner over a GitHub-hosted one?**

* For custom environments (e.g., specific OS, tools, or hardware like GPUs)
* To avoid GitHub-hosted minute limits
* For internal networking needs (e.g., behind a firewall)

---

### 3. **Can a workflow choose a specific type of runner?**

Yes. Use the `runs-on:` key to select either a GitHub-hosted label (`ubuntu-latest`) or a custom label for self-hosted runners.

---

### 4. **Are self-hosted runners secure?**

They can be secure, but **you** must handle:

* OS patching
* Secure network/firewall rules
* Limiting who can trigger workflows that use the runner

---

## ðŸ§© **Scenario-Based Questions with Answers**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** Your CI jobs need to run on macOS and test Swift apps. What runner do you use?

**A:**

```yaml
runs-on: macos-latest
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You want to use your internal server (with special software) for builds. How do you set this up?

**A:**

* Register the machine as a self-hosted runner using GitHub CLI or UI.
* Use `runs-on: self-hosted` in your workflow.
* Optionally add labels for filtering (e.g., `self-hosted`, `linux`, `custom-tag`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** You run out of GitHub-hosted runner minutes. What are your options?

**A:**

* Switch to **self-hosted runners**
* Optimize workflows (cache dependencies, reduce build time)
* Buy additional GitHub Actions minutes if needed
