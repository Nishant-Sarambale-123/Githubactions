Here’s a **detailed explanation** of the **core concepts** of GitHub Actions based on your list:

---

### ✅ **1. Workflow**

A **workflow** is the **entire automation process**, defined in a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows/`.

* It defines **when** automation should run (e.g., on push, PR, or schedule).
* It can contain **multiple jobs** that run in sequence or parallel.
* Each workflow is **version-controlled** with your code, following Infrastructure as Code principles.

📂 **Example path:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
🔁 **Typical use:** Build → Test → Deploy pipeline

---

### ✅ **2. Job**

A **job** is a collection of **steps** that run **together on the same runner** (machine).
Jobs can run **in parallel or sequentially**, based on dependencies.

* Each job has its own environment.
* Jobs can pass data using **artifacts or outputs**.

🔧 **Example:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps: [...]
```

---

### ✅ **3. Step**

A **step** is a **single task** inside a job. It can be:

* A command/script (e.g., `run: npm install`)
* An external action (e.g., `uses: actions/checkout@v3`)

Steps **share the same environment** within a job and execute **in order**.

🔹 Common uses:

* Running shell commands
* Installing dependencies
* Checking out code
* Uploading build artifacts

---

### ✅ **4. Runner**

A **runner** is the **machine** (virtual or physical) that executes jobs.

* **GitHub-hosted runners:** Managed by GitHub (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`)
* **Self-hosted runners:** Your own machines (used for custom environments, more control)

Each job runs on a fresh runner (unless you use caching or persistent storage).

🖥️ Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

### ✅ **5. Action**

An **action** is a **reusable unit of code** used within a step.

* Can be defined by **you** or pulled from the **GitHub Marketplace**
* Written in JavaScript or Docker
* Helps abstract repetitive tasks (e.g., setup Node.js, deploy to AWS)

🔧 Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```

---

### ✅ **6. Event**

An **event** is what **triggers the workflow**.

Common events:

* `push`: When code is pushed to the repository
* `pull_request`: When a PR is opened or updated
* `schedule`: Cron-based automatic trigger
* `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger via UI/API

🔁 Example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

Let me know if you'd like visual diagrams, a YAML template, or interview questions for this section.

Here are **interview questions**, **scenario-based questions**, and their **answers** specifically based on the **Core Concepts** of GitHub Actions:

---

## ✅ **Interview Questions (with Sample Answers)**

### 1. **What is a workflow in GitHub Actions?**

A workflow is a YAML-defined automation process stored in the `.github/workflows/` directory. It can consist of one or more jobs that run in response to specific events like `push`, `pull_request`, or manual triggers.

---

### 2. **What is the difference between a job and a step?**

A **job** is a group of **steps** that execute on the same runner.
A **step** is a single task—like running a script or using an action—inside a job.

---

### 3. **What is a runner? Name the types.**

A runner is the server that runs your jobs.
There are two types:

* **GitHub-hosted**: Managed by GitHub (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`)
* **Self-hosted**: Custom machine maintained by you for more control or special environments

---

### 4. **What is an action in GitHub Actions?**

An action is a reusable unit of code that performs a task, such as setting up a programming language or deploying to a cloud provider. It can be used via the `uses:` keyword and is available from the GitHub Marketplace.

---

### 5. **What are events in GitHub Actions? Give examples.**

Events are triggers that cause workflows to run.
Examples include:

* `push`
* `pull_request`
* `workflow_dispatch` (manual)
* `schedule` (cron-based)

---

## 📘 **Scenario-Based Questions (with Answers)**

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 1: Your team wants to lint code on every PR. How will you set this up?**

**Answer:**
I’ll create a workflow YAML file like `.github/workflows/lint.yml` with the `pull_request` event.
In the job, I’ll use steps to:

1. Check out the code
2. Install dependencies
3. Run a linter command (`eslint .` or similar)

```yaml
on: pull_request
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2: You have multiple jobs and want to run `test` only after `build`. How would you define that?**

**Answer:**
Use the `needs:` keyword to define job dependencies.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building"

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo "Testing"
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 3: You want to share code between multiple steps. How is that possible?**

**Answer:**
Steps in a single job **share the same environment**, so I can save output to environment variables or temporary files and access them in later steps.
For cross-job sharing, I’d use **artifacts** or **outputs**.

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 4: You need to run your pipeline on a specific type of machine. How do you configure that?**

**Answer:**
Use the `runs-on:` key in each job.
Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # for Linux  
runs-on: windows-latest # for Windows
```

If I need a custom environment, I can register a **self-hosted runner**.

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 5: Your team wants to re-use the same deployment logic across many repos. What’s your approach?**

**Answer:**
Create a **custom action** or a **reusable workflow**, then publish it to a shared repo.
In each consumer repo, use `uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@v1`.
