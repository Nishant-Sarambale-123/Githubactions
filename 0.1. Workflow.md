Here’s a **detailed explanation** of the **core concepts** of GitHub Actions based on your list:

---

### ✅ **1. Workflow**

A **workflow** is the **entire automation process**, defined in a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows/`.

* It defines **when** automation should run (e.g., on push, PR, or schedule).
* It can contain **multiple jobs** that run in sequence or parallel.
* Each workflow is **version-controlled** with your code, following Infrastructure as Code principles.

📂 **Example path:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
🔁 **Typical use:** Build → Test → Deploy pipeline

---

### ✅ **2. Job**

A **job** is a collection of **steps** that run **together on the same runner** (machine).
Jobs can run **in parallel or sequentially**, based on dependencies.

* Each job has its own environment.
* Jobs can pass data using **artifacts or outputs**.

🔧 **Example:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps: [...]
```

---

### ✅ **3. Step**

A **step** is a **single task** inside a job. It can be:

* A command/script (e.g., `run: npm install`)
* An external action (e.g., `uses: actions/checkout@v3`)

Steps **share the same environment** within a job and execute **in order**.

🔹 Common uses:

* Running shell commands
* Installing dependencies
* Checking out code
* Uploading build artifacts

---

### ✅ **4. Runner**

A **runner** is the **machine** (virtual or physical) that executes jobs.

* **GitHub-hosted runners:** Managed by GitHub (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`)
* **Self-hosted runners:** Your own machines (used for custom environments, more control)

Each job runs on a fresh runner (unless you use caching or persistent storage).

🖥️ Example:

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

---

### ✅ **5. Action**

An **action** is a **reusable unit of code** used within a step.

* Can be defined by **you** or pulled from the **GitHub Marketplace**
* Written in JavaScript or Docker
* Helps abstract repetitive tasks (e.g., setup Node.js, deploy to AWS)

🔧 Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```

---

### ✅ **6. Event**

An **event** is what **triggers the workflow**.

Common events:

* `push`: When code is pushed to the repository
* `pull_request`: When a PR is opened or updated
* `schedule`: Cron-based automatic trigger
* `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger via UI/API

🔁 Example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```
