Here’s a complete explanation of **Status Checks & Badges** in GitHub Actions, along with **interview questions** and **scenario-based examples**:

## ✅ 11. **Status Checks & Badges – Detailed Notes**

---

### 🔹 **Status Checks**

Status checks are automated results from workflows that GitHub uses to determine if code changes meet predefined requirements.

They are often used in:

* Pull request protection rules
* Branch protection settings

✅ Example:

> You can **require all PRs to pass the CI workflow** before merging to `main`.

---

### 🔹 **Enable Status Checks in Branch Protection**

1. Go to your **repo** → **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Under **Branch Protection Rules**, select a branch (e.g., `main`)
3. Enable:

   * ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   * ✅ Choose workflows like `CI / build` or `test`

This ensures no unverified code gets merged.

---

### 🔹 **Badges**

Badges are visual indicators (like a green ✅ or red ❌) you add to your README to show the workflow status (e.g., CI passed or failed).

### ✅ Example Markdown:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/user/repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

🟢 Green: Workflow succeeded
🔴 Red: Workflow failed
⚫️ Grey: Not yet run or disabled

---

### 📌 Badge URL Format:

```text
https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/actions/workflows/<workflow-file>.yml/badge.svg
```

✅ Customize it for:

* `ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`, etc.
* Personal or organization repos

## 🎯 **Interview Questions + Answers**

---

### 1. **What is a status check in GitHub Actions?**

A status check shows whether a workflow (like tests or build) passed. GitHub can use it to block merges into protected branches if the check fails.

---

### 2. **How do you enforce that only successful workflows can merge to main?**

Use **branch protection rules**:

* Require status checks to pass before merging
* Select the workflows you want to enforce

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of a GitHub Actions badge in a README?**

It shows the **current status** (pass/fail) of a workflow visually, improving transparency for contributors and users.

---

### 4. **What happens if a badge shows red?**

It means the workflow failed on the default branch. This could indicate failing tests, broken builds, or configuration issues.

---

## 🧩 **Scenario-Based Questions + Answers**

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** Your organization requires all code merged to `main` to pass CI tests. How do you enforce this?

**A:**
Set a branch protection rule:

* Go to repo settings → Branches
* Protect `main`
* Enable "Require status checks to pass"
* Select the relevant workflow(s)

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You want users to see your CI status at a glance on GitHub. What do you do?

**A:**
Add a badge to your `README.md`:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** You renamed your workflow from `ci.yml` to `build.yml`, but the badge shows grey. Why?

**A:**
Badges are tied to the **workflow file name**. You must update the badge URL:

```markdown
![Build](https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 4:**

**Q:** Your pull request is blocked even though all workflows passed. What could be the reason?

**A:**
Possible causes:

* The workflow name changed but the status check name in branch protection was not updated.
* The status check is **optional**, not **required**.
* Workflow did not run on the `pull_request` event.
