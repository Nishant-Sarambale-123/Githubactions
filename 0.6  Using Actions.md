Here’s a detailed breakdown of **"Using Actions"** in GitHub Actions workflows, along with **interview and scenario-based questions** for preparation:

---

## ✅ **6. Using Actions – Detailed Notes**

---

### 🔹 **What is an Action in GitHub Actions?**

An **action** is a **reusable piece of automation code** that performs a specific task within a step of a GitHub Actions workflow.

* Actions simplify repetitive tasks like checking out code, setting up languages, uploading artifacts, etc.
* You can use **official actions**, **community (Marketplace) actions**, or **custom-built actions**.

---

### 🔹 **Types of Actions**

#### ✅ **1. Official GitHub Actions**

Developed and maintained by GitHub. Reliable and commonly used.

| Example                   | Description                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `actions/checkout`        | Checks out code to the runner         |
| `actions/setup-node`      | Installs Node.js                      |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | Uploads files from the runner         |
| `actions/cache`           | Caches dependencies for faster builds |

📄 Example:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

---

#### ✅ **2. Marketplace Actions**

Created by the community and available on the **GitHub Actions Marketplace**.

📄 Example (Deploy to Firebase):

```yaml
- uses: w9jds/firebase-action@v12.4.0
  with:
    args: deploy --only hosting
```

---

#### ✅ **3. Custom Actions**

You can build your own action in:

* **JavaScript**: Direct execution with Node.js
* **Docker**: Run in isolated containers for OS-level operations

🛠️ Useful when:

* Your task isn’t covered by existing actions
* You need secure, proprietary logic

---

### 🔹 **How to Use an Action in YAML**

Each action is used in a **step** with the `uses:` keyword.

📄 Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: 18
```

---

## 🎯 **Interview Questions with Answers**

---

### 1. **What are GitHub Actions 'actions'?**

An **action** is a reusable script or container used to automate a specific task (like checking out code, setting up Node, caching, etc.) in a workflow step.

---

### 2. **What’s the difference between `run:` and `uses:` in a step?**

* `run:` executes shell commands.
* `uses:` calls a GitHub Action (either from the Marketplace or defined locally).

---

### 3. **Can you create your own GitHub Action? How?**

Yes. You can create:

* **JavaScript actions** (for quick scripting)
* **Docker container actions** (for isolated environments)

They require an `action.yml` file and can be published for reuse.

---

### 4. **Where can you find third-party GitHub Actions?**

In the [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).

---

### 5. **What is the versioning format used in actions like `actions/checkout@v4`?**

It's GitHub’s way to specify a release version, tag, or commit hash.
Example: `@v4` = latest v4.x release.

---

## 🧩 **Scenario-Based Questions with Answers**

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** You need to set up Node.js version 18 in your workflow. How do you do it?

**A:**

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 18
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You want to use an action to cache `npm` dependencies. What action would you use?

**A:**

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** Your team has a custom deployment script and wants to package it as an action. How would you approach it?

**A:**

* Create a new GitHub repo or folder
* Add an `action.yml` file describing inputs and outputs
* Write the logic in JavaScript or Dockerfile
* Reference it in workflows via:

  ```yaml
  uses: org-name/custom-deploy-action@v1
  ```

---

### 🔹 **Scenario 4:**

**Q:** You want to reuse the same logic across multiple workflows or repos. What’s your best approach?

**A:**
Create a **custom action** or a **reusable workflow**, publish it, and use `uses:` in each target repo.
