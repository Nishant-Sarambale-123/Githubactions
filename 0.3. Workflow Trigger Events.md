Hereâ€™s a **detailed explanation** of the key **workflow trigger events** in GitHub Actions along with **interview and scenario-based questions**:

---

## âœ… **3. Workflow Trigger Events â€“ Detailed Notes**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **`push`**

* **When it triggers:** Every time a commit is pushed to the repository.
* **Use case:** Automatically build, test, or deploy on new code changes.
* **Example:**

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **`pull_request`**

* **When it triggers:** When a pull request is opened, synchronized (updated), or reopened.
* **Use case:** Run tests or lint checks before merging code into main branches.
* **Example:**

  ```yaml
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **`schedule`**

* **When it triggers:** Based on a CRON syntax schedule.
* **Use case:** Nightly builds, regular cleanups, security scans.
* **Example:**

  ```yaml
  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: "0 0 * * *" # every day at midnight UTC
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **`workflow_dispatch`**

* **When it triggers:** Manually via GitHub UI or REST API.
* **Use case:** Ad-hoc deployments, hotfixes, or parameterized scripts.
* **Example:**

  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs:
        environment:
          description: 'Deployment environment'
          required: true
          default: 'staging'
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Other Events**

GitHub Actions supports many other triggers, like:

| Event              | Description                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `release`          | Triggered on release creation/publish                      |
| `deployment`       | Triggered on deployment events                             |
| `issue_comment`    | On new or edited comments on issues/PRs                    |
| `watch`            | When someone stars the repository                          |
| `fork`             | When the repository is forked                              |
| `registry_package` | When a package is published to the GitHub Package Registry |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Interview Questions with Answers**

---

### 1. **What is the difference between `push` and `pull_request` triggers?**

* `push` runs workflows when commits are pushed to a branch.
* `pull_request` runs when a pull request is opened or updated, helping validate code **before** it merges.

---

### 2. **How would you run a workflow manually in GitHub Actions?**

Use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger. You can even define **input parameters** to customize execution.

---

### 3. **What is the purpose of `schedule` in GitHub Actions?**

Itâ€™s used to run workflows automatically on a **time-based schedule** using CRON syntax. Useful for tasks like daily testing, backups, or reporting.

---

### 4. **Can you trigger workflows on issue comments?**

Yes, using the `issue_comment` event. You can add logic to trigger workflows based on specific comment content.

---

## ðŸ§© **Scenario-Based Questions with Answers**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 1: Your team wants to run nightly tests at 2 AM IST. How would you configure this?**

**Answer:**
Use the `schedule` event with the correct UTC time:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "20 20 * * *" # 2:20 AM IST = 20:50 UTC (adjust for DST if needed)
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 2: You want to run tests only when someone opens a pull request into `develop` branch.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3: You want a workflow that triggers only when someone manually requests it.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

This lets you run the workflow on-demand via GitHub UI or API.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 4: You need a deployment pipeline that accepts inputs like `environment` and `version`.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'production'
      version:
        description: 'Version to deploy'
        required: false
```

Would you like a cheat sheet of all events or a sample repo with different trigger examples?

Here are **interview questions** and **scenario-based questions with answers** focused on **GitHub Actions Workflow Trigger Events** like `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, etc.

---

## âœ… **Interview Questions & Answers â€“ Trigger Events**

---

### 1. **What are GitHub Actions trigger events?**

Trigger events are specific GitHub activities (like push, pull request, or manual trigger) that **start a workflow**. These events are defined in the `on:` section of the workflow file.

---

### 2. **Whatâ€™s the difference between `push` and `pull_request` triggers?**

* `push`: Triggers the workflow whenever code is pushed to a specified branch.
* `pull_request`: Triggers the workflow when a pull request is created, updated, or reopened, allowing validation before merge.

---

### 3. **What is the use of `schedule` in GitHub Actions?**

The `schedule` trigger runs workflows **at specific time intervals** using CRON syntax. Itâ€™s useful for tasks like:

* Nightly builds
* Auto backups
* Security scans

---

### 4. **How can you trigger a workflow manually in GitHub Actions?**

Use the `workflow_dispatch` event. It allows **manual execution** of workflows via GitHub UI or API, and you can define **inputs** to parameterize it.

---

### 5. **Can GitHub Actions be triggered on non-code events like issues or comments?**

Yes, GitHub supports many other triggers such as `issue_comment`, `release`, `deployment`, and more. These allow workflows to run on community or lifecycle events.

---

## ðŸ“˜ **Scenario-Based Questions & Answers â€“ Trigger Events**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 1: Your team wants to auto-deploy the app every time code is pushed to the `main` branch. How would you configure this?**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

This configuration ensures the workflow runs on every push to `main`, which you can use for deployment steps.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 2: A developer opens a pull request to merge feature code into `develop`. You want to run tests before merge.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
```

This will trigger test jobs whenever a PR targets the `develop` branch.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3: You need to run a nightly database cleanup script.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 22 * * *' # Runs at 3:30 AM IST (22:00 UTC)
```

This runs the workflow daily at the scheduled time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 4: You want to allow a team member to manually trigger a deployment to production by selecting the environment.**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Target environment'
        required: true
        default: 'production'
```

This allows manual triggering from the GitHub UI with an environment selector.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 5: You want to run a workflow when someone comments "run tests" on a pull request.**

**Answer:**
Use `issue_comment` with conditional logic inside the workflow:

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  run-tests:
    if: github.event.comment.body == 'run tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests"
```
