Here's a detailed explanation of the **Workflow YAML Structure** based on your example:

---

## âœ… **Workflow YAML Structure Breakdown**

### ðŸ”¹ **1. `name:`**

```yaml
name: CI Workflow
```

* **Purpose:** Defines the **name** of the workflow, shown in the **GitHub Actions tab**.
* You can choose any descriptive name (e.g., "Build & Test", "Deploy to Production").

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. `on:`**

```yaml
on: [push]
```

* **Purpose:** Specifies the **event that triggers** the workflow.
* In this case, the workflow runs on every `push` to any branch.
* Can be expanded to other events like `pull_request`, `schedule`, or `workflow_dispatch`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. `jobs:`**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    ...
```

* A **workflow** is made up of one or more **jobs**.
* Each job contains a series of **steps** and runs in a **clean runner environment**.
* Jobs can run **in parallel** or be **dependent on other jobs** using `needs:`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. `build:`**

```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

* `build` is the **name of the job**.
* `runs-on:` specifies the **runner** (virtual machine) to execute the job.
* `ubuntu-latest` is a GitHub-hosted runner with preinstalled tools (like Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. `steps:`**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

* **Steps** are individual tasks executed **in order** inside a job.
* They can use:

  * **Built-in or marketplace actions** (`uses:`)
  * **Shell commands/scripts** (`run:`)
* All steps in a job share the **same workspace** and environment.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step Details:**

#### âœ… Checkout Code

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

* Downloads your repository code to the runner so it can be built/tested.

---

#### âœ… Set Up Node.js

```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 18
```

* Installs Node.js version 18 on the runner.
* Makes Node and npm available to future steps.

---

#### âœ… Install Dependencies

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install
```

* Installs all `npm` packages listed in `package.json`.

---

#### âœ… Run Tests

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test
```

* Executes the project's test suite (as defined in `package.json` under the `test` script).

## ðŸ§© **Scenario-Based Interview Questions (with Answers)**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 1:**

**Q:** A developer wants to run tests on every push to `main` branch only. How would you modify the YAML?

**A:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 2:**

**Q:** You want to add a job to deploy the app after tests pass. What would you add?

**A:**

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    ...
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying application"
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Scenario 3:**

**Q:** You need to run this workflow manually with an environment parameter. How?

**A:**

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
```

Would you like this example extended with linting, deployment, or a matrix strategy (e.g., test on Node 16 & 18)?
